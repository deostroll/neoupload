A cross browser file upload jQuery plugin

This project is meant to support a video describing asynchronous processing design pattern in JavaScript.
The video is still under construction as of the moment. People are advised to not directly contribute to this 
project, as that would make no sense at all. However, if you wish to build on top of this code base, you are 
always welcome to fork it.

This github will be a good start for people interested in learning about how to make an asynchronous file upload using 
the ever classical iframe based workarounds.

The idea for an asynchronous file upload was originally inspired by Andrew Valums.
